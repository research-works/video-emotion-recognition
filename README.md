**How to use this work ?**

- Two configuration files `config.ini` and `fusion_training_hyparam.json` are required under the `utils` directory for this 
project to run. The details of these files can be inferred from source code itself or by can be requested by sending a mail at `abhishekbisht@gmail.com`.
- `config.ini` is needed to provide the directory paths such as those of datasets.
- `fusion_training_hyparam.json` is needed to supply the aprropriate hyperparameters for training.
